Hi XYZ,

I am glad to see that I have piqued your interest. Let me tell you more!

As mentioned before, we would like to develop a course on ABC. Our books on similar topics, IJK, LMN, etc., have been best sellers and we are hoping to achieve the same amount of appreciation for this course too! I am sure it will be, with your expertise and our support!

Our courses are usually 3-4 hours long. It can slightly vary according to the topics or content. The course will be divided into sections with each section covering a topic or application. It will be developed based on the outline that we can both work on.

Now you must be thinking what will be the timeline for this? We would like the course to start in the first week of July and end in October; so that makes it a publishing time of 3 months. This will include the development, production and post-production stages. We will share a detailed timeline with you once the outline is finalized.

All you have to do is:

·         Develop an outline for the course. I do have some rough ideas for the outline but I would like your suggestions on it

·         Record the course, i.e., screencast and voice over at any preferred location. We have our in-house recording software, Panopto that will help you record good quality videos according to Packt standards. Our Development team will guide you through that process.

You would receive an advance amount of $1000 and an ongoing royalty of 16% on the net sales. The advance will be paid against future royalties.

Along with Packt, your course will be published across our various channels like Udemy, PluralSight, etc., So it will have a larger market presence and will reach your target audience.

You can check out some of our playlists on YouTube to understand our product better:

I am looking forward to hearing your ideas and work with you as an Author!
