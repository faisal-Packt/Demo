Hi Dave!

Hope you're doing well!

I am Faisal Sayed, an Acquisition Editor at Packt Publishing.We publish books for all levels of I.T. users across Enterprise and Open Source software (www.packtpub.com if you would like to have a look).

We are looking forward to create a course on "Python for Data Science".

I went through your LinkedIn profile, Git repositories and even through your YouTube channel and was really impressed with the level of expertease and experience you have in this field of Data Science.

It will be great if you could spare some time and work with us to create this course and help us provide the right resource to the students and developers out there.

I Look forward to a favourable and positive response from your side.

Regards,
